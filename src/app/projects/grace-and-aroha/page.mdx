# Grace and Aroha: Educational Website Evolution

A thoughtfully designed website for my daughter's daycare teacher that transformed from a simple static site into a sophisticated content management platform, enabling seamless blog publishing while maintaining excellent SEO performance.

## Project Evolution Story

### The Initial Need
Created for a passionate early childhood educator who wanted to:
- Share educational resources with parents and the community
- Showcase her teaching philosophy and approach
- Provide a professional online presence for her growing reputation

### Phase 1: Hand-Crafted Foundation (2020)
**Tech Stack:** Pure HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

Initially built as a beautifully crafted static website focusing on:
- Clean, accessible design prioritising content readability
- Mobile-first responsive layout for parent accessibility
- Fast loading times with optimised images and minimal dependencies
- SEO-friendly semantic HTML structure

### Phase 2: Dynamic Content Management (2021)
**Evolved Tech Stack:** Next.js, Strapi CMS, Heroku ‚Üí Railway

When the need for regular blog content emerged, I transformed the static site into a modern JAMstack application:

## Technical Architecture


### Strapi CMS Integration
Implemented a headless CMS solution providing:
- **Intuitive Content Editor:** Rich text editing with media management
- **Custom Content Types:** Blog posts, resources, testimonials
- **Role-Based Access:** Secure content management for the educator
- **API-First Architecture:** RESTful and GraphQL endpoints

### Automated Publishing Pipeline
Created a seamless content publishing workflow:

1. **Content Creation:** Educator writes posts in Strapi's user-friendly interface
2. **Webhook Trigger:** Strapi sends webhook on content publish/update
3. **Site Rebuild:** Next.js rebuilds affected pages with new content
4. **CDN Invalidation:** Automatic cache clearing for instant updates
