# Pilot Prep: Next-Generation Aviation Learning Platform

An advanced multi-tenant Learning Management System specifically designed for pilot training and aviation education, enabling training organisations to deliver interactive, engaging courses while maintaining their brand identity.

## The Challenge

Having spent years in aviation training myself, I witnessed firsthand the frustration of students struggling with outdated learning materials. Picture this: aspiring pilots hunched over dense PDFs at 2 AM, trying to memorise complex navigation procedures from static diagrams that barely resembled the dynamic, interactive nature of actual flying. Training organisations were stuck with generic LMS platforms that treated aviation education like any other online course, completely missing the visual, hands-on essence of what it means to become a pilot.

The breaking point came when I saw talented students dropping out not because they lacked ability, but because the learning experience felt disconnected from the reality of aviation. Training organisations were equally frustrated, unable to differentiate themselves in a competitive market while being limited by one-size-fits-all educational platforms that didn't understand their unique needs.

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Infrastructure

The architecture needed to be elegant yet powerful, supporting everything from individual students purchasing courses to entire flight schools white-labeling the platform as their own. I spent countless hours architecting a system that could seamlessly serve both markets without compromise.

The frontend leverages React with TypeScript, creating an experience that feels native and responsive. Every interaction is carefully crafted using TanStack Router for lightning-fast navigation and React Query for intelligent state management that anticipates what students need before they even click. Behind the scenes, the backend runs on Node.js with TRPC, ensuring that every API call is type-safe and robust. This isn't just about preventing bugs‚Äîit's about creating confidence that the platform will work reliably when students are studying for critical examinations.

The infrastructure spans AWS CloudFront and S3 for global content delivery, ensuring that whether you're studying in Auckland or accessing content from a remote airfield, the experience remains consistently fast. Railway handles our containerised deployment, giving us the flexibility to scale rapidly as more training organisations discover what modern aviation education can be.

### Custom Content Management System
Developed a proprietary markdown-to-React parser enabling content creators to build interactive learning modules without technical knowledge.

```typescript
// Example of custom directive usage
::quiz{type="multiple-choice" id="navigation-basics"}
What is the primary purpose of a VOR station?
- Radio navigation aid
- Weather reporting  
- Air traffic control
- Emergency beacon
::
```

**Impact:** Content creation time reduced by 75% compared to traditional course development methods.

### Intelligent Caching Strategy
Implemented multi-layer caching system combining CloudFront edge caching, Redis for API responses, and build-time query pre-caching.

**Performance Results:**
- Initial page load: Under 2 seconds globally
- Subsequent navigation: Sub-200ms response times
- 95% cache hit rate on frequently accessed content
