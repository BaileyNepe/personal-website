## The Problem

Watching my father run his construction business was like watching someone try to juggle while riding a unicycle‚Äîimpressive, but unsustainable. Every Wednesday became a frantic treasure hunt across Hamilton, driving from site to site collecting crumpled paper timesheets from muddy trucks and toolboxes. By the time he'd gathered everyone's hours, half the day was gone, and he'd spend the evening hunched over a calculator, trying to piece together which jobs were making money and which were bleeding cash.

The mental toll was what really got to me. Here was someone who could build anything, solve complex construction challenges, and manage teams of skilled tradies, but he was drowning in paperwork. Late nights were spent staring at spreadsheets, trying to remember if that job in Te Awamutu was supposed to take two days or three, and whether the cost overrun was due to weather delays or poor planning. The business was successful, but it was consuming him, and I knew there had to be a better way.

## Technical Solution

### Version 1.0: Rapid MVP Development
**Tech Stack:** React, MongoDB, Node.js + Express, Auth0, Redux, AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Built initial version during my studies at Developers Institute, focusing on core functionality:
- Digital timesheet submission with job assignment
- Basic job tracking and reporting
- Simple scheduling interface

### Version 2.0: Complete Redesign & Enhancement
**Upgraded Tech Stack:** TypeScript, TRPC, PostgreSQL, enhanced AWS infrastructure

Rebuilt from the ground up with lessons learned and modern technologies.

## Key Features & Impact

### Digital Timesheet Revolution

The transformation started with something deceptively simple: replacing paper timesheets with a mobile-optimised web interface. But the impact was profound. Instead of my father burning entire afternoons driving around Hamilton collecting pieces of paper, his employees could now submit their hours from wherever they were working. The change was immediate and dramatic.

What amazed me most was watching the ripple effects. Payroll processing, which used to stretch across three days of careful calculation and double-checking, suddenly became a same-day affair. Errors virtually disappeared because the system validated entries in real-time, catching impossible hour combinations or missing job codes before they could cause problems. The eight hours per week my father had been spending on timesheet collection became eight hours he could spend actually running his business, visiting sites, or‚Äîrevolutionary concept‚Äîgoing home at a reasonable time.
