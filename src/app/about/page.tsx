              My journey into technology started from an unexpected place â€“ the aviation
              industry. After completing my Level 6 Diploma in Aviation at Waikato
              Aviation, I spent several years as a flight instructor, eventually becoming
              Deputy Chief Flying Instructor. Those years taught me precision, attention
              to detail, and the importance of clear communication â€“ skills that translate
              surprisingly well to software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              The transition from aviation to tech wasn't immediate. I discovered my
              passion for programming while looking for ways to solve operational
              challenges in the flight training environment. What started as automating
              simple tasks grew into a fascination with building comprehensive digital
              solutions.

              I completed my Level 6 Diploma in Software Development at Developers
              Institute, graduating with distinction. This formal education, combined with
              my aviation background, gave me a unique perspective on building reliable,
              user-focused applications where failure isn't an option.

              Today, I work as a Software Engineer at NumberWorks'nWords, where I develop
              educational technology solutions that help thousands of students across
              Australia and New Zealand. I'm also actively developing Pilot Prep, an
              advanced aviation training platform that combines my two worlds â€“ bringing
              modern educational technology to pilot training.
            </p>

              Whether I'm building multi-tenant platforms with AI integration or crafting
              business management systems, I focus on creating scalable, user-centric
              solutions that solve real problems. My aviation background reminds me that
              great software, like great flying, requires careful planning, attention to
              detail, and a commitment to continuous improvement.
