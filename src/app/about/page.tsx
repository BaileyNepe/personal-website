              My journey into technology began with a unique background in aviation, where
              I advanced to Deputy Chief Flying Instructor after achieving perfect
              academic records in commercial pilot training. This experience instilled a
              systematic approach to problem-solving and an appreciation for building
              reliable, well-architected systems. Transitioning to software engineering, I
              bring the same methodical thinking and attention to detail to crafting
              technical solutions that businesses can depend on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The transition from aviation to tech came during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown
              when I had time to really examine the inefficiencies plaguing aviation
              training. I watched talented students struggle with outdated PDFs and
              generic learning platforms that completely missed the visual, interactive
              nature of pilot education. Training organisations were stuck with
              one-size-fits-all systems that didn't understand their unique needs. That's
              when I started building pilot-specific online courses and digital materials
              for private tutoring, discovering a passion for creating educational
              technology that actually solved real problems.

              I completed my Level 6 Diploma in Software Development at Developers
              Institute, achieving A+ grades across all modules while working full-time at
              NumberWorks'nWords â€“ demonstrating exceptional time management and the
              ability to immediately apply classroom learning to real-world challenges.
              This intensive experience, combined with my aviation background, gave me a
              unique perspective on building reliable, user-focused applications where
              failure isn't an option.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I work as a Software Engineer at NumberWorks'nWords, where I
              architect solutions for an educational platform serving thousands of
              students across 70+ franchise centres. I led a complete infrastructure
              transformationâ€”migrating from a fragile single EC2 instance to a scalable,
              containerised AWS ECS environment. This resulted in 99.9% uptime, 45-minute
              to 5-minute deployment times, and dashboard performance improvements from
              10+ seconds to 100ms. These technical improvements directly translated to
              better tutor productivity and enhanced student learning experiences.

            <p>
              Beyond my full-time role, I develop comprehensive solutions for diverse
              business challenges. Pilot Prep is an advanced multi-tenant aviation LMS
              featuring AI-powered tutoring and white-label capabilities, while Dreams
              Built transformed construction management by eliminating 85% of
              administrative overhead through intelligent timesheet automation and
              real-time job costing. Whether I'm architecting multi-tenant platforms,
              implementing performance optimisations, or building automated deployment
              pipelines, I focus on creating end-to-end solutions that solve real
              problems. My systematic approach ensures that every solution I build is
              scalable, maintainable, and delivers measurable business value.
