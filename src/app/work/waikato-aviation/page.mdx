# Waikato Aviation: Professional Aviation Career Journey

A comprehensive career progression through New Zealand's aviation industry, from administrative support to senior flight instruction leadership, culminating in an airline job offer and transition to software development during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Aviation Background & Foundation

### Early Aviation Passion

My love affair with aviation began at 13 when most kids were obsessing over video games. Every weekend, I'd head to the local airfield, absorbing everything I could about flying. There's something magical about the moment you realise you can actually control an aircraft—when the theory clicks with reality and you're no longer just a passenger but a pilot.

The competitive flying circuit became my proving ground. Winning two consecutive national competitions wasn't just about the trophies; it was about pushing myself to achieve precision under pressure, something that would serve me well in every future endeavour. The real milestone came on my 16th birthday when I took my first solo flight—the youngest age legally possible. I still remember the mixture of terror and exhilaration as the instructor stepped out of the aircraft and said, "She's all yours." That moment of absolute responsibility, where success or failure rested entirely on my decisions and skills, shaped my approach to challenges for life.

### Flight Instructor (2016-2018)
**Educational Philosophy:**

Teaching someone to fly isn't just about transferring technical knowledge—it's about building confidence while maintaining respect for the awesome responsibility of flight. I developed an approach that recognised each student as an individual with unique learning patterns, fears, and motivations. Some students needed encouragement to push beyond their comfort zones, while others needed reining in to develop proper caution.

My philosophy centred on creating connections between concepts rather than rote memorisation. Why does an aircraft stall? Understanding the physics helps, but connecting it to how it feels through the controls, what it looks like outside the windscreen, and when it might happen in real operations creates lasting knowledge. I wanted my students to graduate not just as pilots who could pass tests, but as aviators who truly understood their craft and could make sound decisions when faced with the unexpected situations that aviation inevitably presents.
