# NumberWorks'nWords: Transforming Educational Technology

A journey of technical growth and infrastructure transformation at New Zealand's leading educational technology company, where I evolved from a junior developer to a key technical contributor driving platform modernisation and performance optimisation.

## Company Overview

NumberWorks'nWords operates as a franchise-based tutoring organisation across Australia and New Zealand, combining traditional in-centre learning with modern cloud-based education technology. The platform serves:

- **70+ franchise centres** with unique operational requirements
- **Thousands of students** aged 5-16 across mathematics and English
- **Cloud-based learners** accessing content remotely
- **Content creators** developing interactive educational materials

## Technical Evolution & Key Achievements

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Modernisation: Single EC2 to Containerised ECS

**The Challenge:** 

Walking into NumberWorks'nWords, I discovered a platform serving thousands of students across 70+ centres was hanging by a thread. The entire system ran on a single EC2 instance, and deployments were literally a game of Russian roulette—someone would manually drag and drop files, hold their breath, and hope nothing broke. When things inevitably went wrong (and they did, regularly), frustrated tutors couldn't access student progress, parents couldn't see their children's achievements, and our support team fielded angry calls from franchise owners watching their businesses grind to a halt.

The most heartbreaking part wasn't the technical debt—it was seeing the impact on students. When the platform crashed during peak tutoring hours, kids who had been building momentum in their learning journey suddenly hit a wall. That's not just a technical failure; that's a barrier to education, and it was happening far too often.

**My Solution:**

I knew we needed more than a quick fix—this called for a complete reimagining of how we delivered education technology. The transformation began with containerising the entire application using Docker, creating isolated, predictable environments that behaved identically whether running on my laptop or serving thousands of students in production.

```yaml
# Docker containerisation with multi-stage builds
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

The migration to AWS ECS transformed our deployment story from nail-biting manual processes to seamless, automated releases. I implemented auto-scaling and load balancing, so the platform could gracefully handle everything from quiet Sunday afternoons to the chaos of exam week when hundreds of students log in simultaneously. CloudFront integration meant students in rural areas could access content just as quickly as those in major cities, while the migration to Amazon RDS gave us bulletproof data reliability with automated backups that actually worked.

Perhaps most importantly, I built a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Now, every code change goes through rigorous automated testing before reaching students, and deployments happen with the confidence that comes from knowing the system has been thoroughly validated.

**Measurable Impact:**
- **Deployment time:** Reduced from 45 minutes to 5 minutes
- **Deployment success rate:** Improved from 60% to 99.8%
- **System uptime:** Increased from 95% to 99.9%
- **Developer productivity:** Eliminated manual deployment steps for entire team

### 📊 Performance Optimisation: From Seconds to Milliseconds

**The Challenge:**
Critical dashboard loading performance was severely impacting user experience:
- **Initial load time:** 10+ seconds for tutor dashboards
- **Database bottlenecks:** Inefficient queries on large datasets
- **API response times:** 3-5 seconds for frequently accessed data
- **User frustration:** Tutors unable to efficiently manage student progress

**My Technical Solutions:**

#### Redis Caching Implementation
```javascript
// Intelligent caching with automatic invalidation
const getCachedStudentProgress = async (studentId) => {
  const cacheKey = `student:${studentId}:progress`;
  
  let cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
  
  const progress = await calculateStudentProgress(studentId);
  await redis.setex(cacheKey, 3600, JSON.stringify(progress));
  
  return progress;
};

// WebSocket partial updates for real-time sync
const invalidateCache = async (studentId, updates) => {
  await redis.del(`student:${studentId}:progress`);
  wsServer.emit(`student:${studentId}:update`, updates);
};
```

#### Database Optimisation
- **Table partitioning:** Partitioned large student activity tables by date
- **Strategic indexing:** Added composite indexes reducing query time by 95%
- **Query optimisation:** Converted N+1 queries to efficient JOINs
- **CTE implementation:** Used Common Table Expressions for complex reporting

```sql
-- Optimised student progress query with CTE
WITH student_activities AS (
  SELECT 
    student_id,
    lesson_id,
    completion_percentage,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY lesson_id ORDER BY created_at DESC) as rn
  FROM student_lesson_progress 
  WHERE student_id = $1 AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
),
latest_activities AS (
  SELECT * FROM student_activities WHERE rn = 1
)
SELECT 
  l.title,
  la.completion_percentage,
  l.difficulty_level
FROM latest_activities la
JOIN lessons l ON la.lesson_id = l.id
ORDER BY l.sequence_order;
```

**Performance Results:**
- **Dashboard load time:** Reduced from 10+ seconds to 100ms
- **API response time:** Improved from 3-5 seconds to 50ms average
- **Database query performance:** 95% improvement on critical queries
- **Cache hit rate:** Achieved 85% cache hit rate on frequently accessed data

### 🚀 Frontend Optimisation & User Experience

**React Component Optimisation:**
```javascript
// Implemented intelligent memoisation and lazy loading
const StudentDashboard = React.memo(({ studentId }) => {
  const { data: student } = useQuery(
    ['student', studentId],
    () => fetchStudent(studentId),
    { staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000 } // 5-minute cache
  );

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<DashboardSkeleton />}>
      <LazyStudentProgress studentId={studentId} />
    </Suspense>
  );
});

// Code splitting for reduced bundle size
const LazyStudentProgress = lazy(() => 
  import('./StudentProgress').then(module => ({
    default: module.StudentProgress
  }))
);
```

**Advanced Compression Implementation:**
- **Brotli compression:** Implemented for API responses reducing bandwidth by 40%
- **Asset optimisation:** WebP image conversion with fallbacks
- **Bundle splitting:** Route-based code splitting reducing initial load

### 🔧 DevOps & Quality Assurance

**Staging Environment Creation:**
Established production-mirror staging environment enabling:
- **Safe feature testing** before production deployment
- **Data consistency** with automated production data sync
- **Performance testing** under realistic load conditions
- **Cross-browser testing** across multiple devices

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
```javascript
// Health check endpoints with detailed metrics
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const dbStatus = await checkDatabaseConnection();
  const redisStatus = await checkRedisConnection();
  const memoryUsage = process.memoryUsage();
  
  res.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    services: { database: dbStatus, cache: redisStatus },
    memory: memoryUsage
  });
});
```

Created reusable React components for educational content creators:

```jsx
// Custom directive for interactive math problems
const MathProblem = ({ equation, hints, solution }) => {
  const [userAnswer, setUserAnswer] = useState('');
  const [showHint, setShowHint] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div className="math-problem">
      <Equation latex={equation} />
      <AnswerInput 
        value={userAnswer}
        onChange={setUserAnswer}
        onSubmit={() => checkAnswer(userAnswer, solution)}
      />
